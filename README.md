These files are a part of Stephen Anim's submission for Treehouse's Front-End Web Development Techdegree project "Web Style Guide". It should meet the requirements for Exceeds Expectations.

This project involves the use of Sass, the CSS preprocessor, to demonstrate skill in this popular means of writing scalable CSS.

The media query breakpoints used in this project follow the recommendations in the Free Code Camp article "The 100% correct way to do CSS breakpoints" found at: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862.
